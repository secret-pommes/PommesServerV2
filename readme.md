<a>I deleted all games from the database in this commit (all of the cracks and others)</a>
<br>
<a>But the database is still filled with some tools (cmd unlocker etc) and wallpapers :)</a>
<br>
<a>-There are many german comments, translate them if you want to :)</a>
<br>
<a>-Has some functions that arent complete.</a>
<br>
<a>-Shity Code and slow on startup, thats why i made a new backend for the "Pommes-Server-V2" (v2.2.2)</a>
